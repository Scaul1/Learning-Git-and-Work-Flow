# Learning-Git-and-Work-Flow

## Applications used:
* _Atom_ - text editor
* _Git bash_ used to clone projects from github and work on them on my local computer

## Steps to use my work flow for projects:
### 1. Git clone
This copies my work to my local computer. (Use the link from that github provides when pressing the clone or download button).

### 2. ls and cd
This step allows me to find my project on my computer then change directory into the project. At this point I can work on my project.

### 3. Git status
Displays the status of the files (modified, staged, ect).

### Git commit - m "message"
Commits the snapshot to the history of my work. After the "m" I can type a message between quotations. 

### Git push
Pushes all of the work I've added or modified to the repository on github so that they're not just local.
